#Online Advisor 

-----------------------
## Project Description
-----------------------
    In our experience as students, it’s been tedious (and sometimes difficult) to identify what classes we need to take, when to take them, and in what order. Advisors aren’t always around either, so it becomes a guessing game if there’s any uncertainty. Our project aims to provide an online advisement system between students and advisors. This will be achieved by providing students with an automated schedule of courses for the upcoming semesters. From there, students can modify the schedule of courses and ask the advisor for input by using the webpage’s messaging system. The advisor can then provide feedback. Finally, the online conversation between students and advisors are logged and can be retrieved at any point by either member.
