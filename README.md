# Schedule Planner


## Project Description
In our experience as students, it is a tedious, and sometimes difficult, process to identify what classes we need to take, when to take them, and in the order in which they should be taken. Advisors aren’t always available. Without their help, if there’s any uncertainty, it becomes a guessing game as to what classes to enroll for. Our project aims to provide an easier and more immediate solution for students to use before, or after, meeting with their advisors to discern a clear course schedule. NOTE: This is in NO WAY meant to replace the advising sessions. Instead, it is a way to explore potential options, similar to how Section Tally does, except more efficient and with a higher benefit. Potentially advisors and students could utilize it during sessions to pre-plan their classes.)

## Goals
Develop a web application product that can automate a schedule of students’ courses based on the degree requirements.  
With our product, we plan for each user to be able to:

**Students**

- Become more knowledgeable in what classes they should take and when they should take them
- An easier way to look at the degree’s requirements and scheduling by creating a platform which    allows you to switch between them
- A better way for students to manage their schedule outside of advising sessions

**Advisors**

- A better and more efficient way to advise students of what classes to enroll in based on their grades, financial plan, etc...

## Limitations
Due to time and experience constraints, the following limitations are put into place:

- Only works with Rowan’s CS curriculum
- There are many different degrees and variations in Rowan. Therefore, with our time restraint, we’re only going to do the CS minor/major/grad options.
- Only will work on browsers
- It’s important for students to be able to access the program from anywhere they are. The best way     to accomplish multiple platforms is by making the program browser based.
- Does not entirely account for classes becoming full or canceled classes.
    This is where the advisors would come in. The program is merely a suggestion. It isn’t tied to the Section Tally at all, therefore there’s no way to be able to change the suggestions in real time/it wouldn’t be accurate.
- Relies slightly on the honesty of students
- Students can enter any grade they want. However, lying will not give them any benefit whatsoever.     It’s still a potential downside regardless of its effect.

## Stretch Goals
If the project has met all deadlines ahead of schedule, we will strive to reach certain stretch goals including (but not limited to):

- Works with multiple degree paths other than CS.
    Such as Math majors, Electronic/Civil/etc... Engineer, and many others
- Add minors for more than just the CS degree
- Ability to integrate compatible classes from other colleges and have the schedule change              accordingly.
- Adding more functionality to graphical view to let the users edit the charts 
- Ability to incorporate graphical view with the semester view.  
- Add a financial tool to accumulate the cost of degrees based on Credit Input
- Incorporate a Time Vs Cost scroll bar to adjust the degree and course requirements accordingly.
