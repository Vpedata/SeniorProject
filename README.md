# Schedule Planner


## Project Decription
In our experience as students, it’s been tedious (and sometimes difficult) to identify what classes we need to take, when to take them, and in what order. Advisors aren’t always around, either, so if there’s any uncertainty, it becomes a guessing game. What our project will aim to do is have a much better way for students to work pre or post meetings with their advisors (this is in NO WAY meant to replace the advising sessions, but a way to explore potential options much like the section tally does, but in a better and efficient way. Potentially advisors and students could utilize it during sessions to pre-plan their classes.)

## Goals
Develop a web application product that can automate a schedule of students courses based on the degree requirements.  
With our product, we plan for each user to be able to:

**Students**

- Become more knowledgeable in what classes they should take and when they should take them
- An easier way to look at the degree’s requirements and scheduling by creating a platform which    allows you to switch between them
- A better way for students to manage their schedule outside of advising sessions

**Advisors**

- A better and efficient way to guide students what classes to take based on grades or financial    plan or etc...

## Limitations
Due to time and experience constraints, the following limitations are put into place:

- Only works with Rowan’s CS curriculum
- There are many different degrees and variations in Rowan. Therefore with our time restraint, we’re    only going to do the CS minor/major/grad options.
- Only will work on browsers
- It’s important for students to be able to access the program from anywhere they are. The best way     to accomplish multiple platforms is by making the program browser based.
- Does not entirely account for classes becoming full or canceled classes.
    This is where the advisors would come in. The program is merely a suggestion. It isn’t tied to the section talley at all, therefore there’s no way to be able to change the suggestions in real time/it wouldn’t be accurate.
- Relies slightly on the honesty of students
- Students can enter any grade they want. However, lying will not give them any benefit whatsoever.     It’s still a potential downside regardless of its effect.

## Stretch Goals
If the project has met all deadlines ahead of schedule, we will strive to reach certain stretch goals including (but not limited to):

- Works with multiple degree paths other than CS.
    Such as Math majors, Electronic/Civil/etc... Engineer, and many others
- Add minors for more than just the CS degree
- Ability to integrate compatible classes from other colleges and have the schedule change              accordingly.
- Adding more functionality to graphical view to let the users edit the charts 
- Ability to incorporate graphical view with the semester view.  
- Add a financial tool to accumulate the cost of degrees based on Credit Input
- Incorporate a Time Vs Cost scroll bar to adjust the degree and course requirements accordingly.
